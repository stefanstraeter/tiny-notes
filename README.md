## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup – structured and accessible elements

- Responsive CSS Grid & Flexbox – adaptive layouts across devices
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) – for DOM manipulation and app logic
- LocalStorage API – persisting notes across browser sessions

- Creating a modular and scalable CSS setup with variables and utility classes
- Designing responsive layouts with Grid and Flexbox that scale from mobile to desktop
- Implementing a functional notes system in plain JavaScript, including:
- Dynamic rendering of notes
